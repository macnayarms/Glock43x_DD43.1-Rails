A printable G l o c k 43X frame.

* DD43.1 Negative/Jig by Phil Phisher, modified/refined by マクネー 武器 and Luke Warm Designs.

## Description
マクネー 武器's 43X is an all-original modeled, revisitation of the Glock 43X. The first release uses DD43.1 rail specifications.

## Materials Required
See included PDF for tools and parts checklist - however -
If you want to use Shield Arms 15rd g43x mags (what I use), you will also need their metal g43x magazine release.***

## Printing Instructions:
* Print the frame standing up, at an angle (probably the strongest orientation), or rails down. 
* Preferred filament should be PLA+, or BETTER (Nylon CF or Nylon CF blend is probably the strongest, at the moment). 
* Print at 50 mm/s @ 230C (eSun PLA+, for example). 
* Use tree supports for easy clean up.* (suggested, adjust to machine/filament).
* Print with at least six walls.
* See included PDF for assembly instructions.

## Future Updates:
* PF9SS rails (finished, just need more beta testers - DM Macnay Arms to join)
* PY2A rails ((finished, just need more beta testers - DM Macnay Arms to join)
